That is one less thing to worry about and that is money well spent.  I was worried that the clips would let go and I'd get an elastic strap to the balls but they are really solid.  The only reason they are not perfect and only 4 stars is that the clamps that you use to adjust the length of the straps are really worthless.  At the slightest tension they just do not hold onto the band on two of the four straps.  Not sure if a defect or not but I still can use them just not to 100% of their abilities.  Still give them a shot they are really good to use of you are always messing around with an untucked shirt.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'A great solution to an annoying problem, but not perfect.', 'unixReviewTime': 1395964800, 'reviewTime': '03 28, 2014'}, {'reviewerID': 'AHPIAD7T6WFL9', 'asin': 'B003S9X0JS', 'reviewerName': 'REBECC', 'helpful': [0, 1], 'reviewText': 'Not so form fittimg like the denim shirt, soft material, lovely color.
